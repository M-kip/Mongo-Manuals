## Query Documents
- Use the db.collection.find() method in the MongoDB Shell to query documents in a collection.

The examples on this page reference the Atlas sample dataset. You can create a free Atlas cluster and populate that cluster with sample data to follow along with these examples. To learn more, see Get Started with Atlas

## Read All Documents in a Collection
To read all documents in the collection, pass an empty document as the query filter parameter to the find method. The query filter parameter determines the select criteria.

### Example
To return all documents from the sample_mflix.movies collection:

``use sample_mflix``
``db.movies.find()``

This operation is equivalent to the following SQL statement:

``SELECT * FROM movies``

## Specify Equality Condition
To select documents which match an equality condition, specify the condition as a <field>:<value> pair in the query filter document.

### Example
To return all movies where the title equals Titanic from the sample_mflix.movies collection:

``use sample_mflix``
``db.movies.find( { "title": "Titanic" } )``

This operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

``SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title = "Titanic"``

## Specify Conditions Using Query Operators
Use query operators in a query filter document to perform more complex comparisons and evaluations. Query operators in a query filter document have the following form:

``{ <field1>: { <operator1>: <value1> }, ... }``

# Example
To return all movies from the sample_mflix.movies collection which are either rated PG or PG-13:

``use sample_mflix``
``db.movies.find( { rated: { $in: [ "PG", "PG-13" ] } } )``

This operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:

``SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rated in ("PG", "PG-13")``
Note
Although you can express this query using the $or operator, use the $in operator rather than the $or operator when performing equality checks on the same field.

## Specify Logical Operators (AND / OR)
A compound query can specify conditions for more than one field in the collection's documents. Implicitly, a logical AND conjunction connects the clauses of a compound query so that the query selects the documents in the collection that match all the conditions.

## Example
To return movies which were released in Mexico and have an IMDB rating of at least 7:

``use sample_mflix``
``db.movies.find( { countries: "Mexico", "imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 } } )``

Use the $or operator to specify a compound query that joins each clause with a logical OR conjunction so that the query selects the documents in the collection that match at least one condition.

## Example
To return movies from the sample_mflix.movies collection which were released in 2010 and either won at least 5 awards or have a genre of Drama:

``use sample_mflix``
``db.movies.find( {``
     ``year: 2010,``
     ``$or: [ { "awards.wins": { $gte: 5 } }, { genres: "Drama" } ]``
``} )``
